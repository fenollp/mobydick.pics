# Cool dick, yo!

Unfortunately I've seen _exactly <ACTUAL LARGE NUMBER> bigger cocks_ than yours :-O
So please refrain from showing me more of your knob, thanks.

Oh, I shared your dick pick with the whole world by the way

## Unsolicited dick sender shaming
* a `/wall` that stores/displays reported dick pics (as anonymously as a dick pic can be)
* a reassuring way to reply & tame such posts (cf. example above)
* a way to collect/share the replies/screenshots, anonymized, again for worldwide shame
* a service that collects both contacts info, in case the Police needs help
    * actually, the victim's phone number + a random number per dick pick should be enough
    * responding to abuse with abuse is risky, this should act as a deterent to further abuse

## Open free libre AI dick models & dataset
* dataset of anonymized RGB pictures, made available through above `/wall` service
    * crowd-sourced curation, inherent penile diversity, better than https://thisdickpicdoesnotexist.com/
* PyTorch models based off of MobileNet, for the tasks of
    * detection
    * classification
* contribute to https://github.com/beezeetee/TDPDNE
